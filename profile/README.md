Based at the University of Oxford, scientists at the [Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology](https://www.kennedy.ox.ac.uk) (KIR) are using computational biolgoy approaches to study the immune system and immune mediated diseases.

## Bioinformatics tools and pipelines developed by Kennedy Groups

* [cellhub](https://github.com/sansomlab/cellhub) provides a best-practise workflow for pre-processing and analysing large scale multimodal single-cell datasets.
* [txseq](https://github.com/sansomlab/txseq) provides best-practice pipelines for the analysis of bulk rna-sequencing data
* [HLADiversity](https://github.com/yang-luo-lab/HLADiversity) is a pipeline for estimating the distinctiveness of HLA alleles.
* [HLA-TAPA](https://github.com/yang-luo-lab/HLA-TAPAS) is a HLA-focused pipeline that can handle HLA reference panel construction (MakeReference), HLA imputation (SNP2HLA), and HLA association (HLAassoc).
* [cov-LDSC](https://github.com/yang-luo-lab/cov-ldsc)  is a method to provide robust hg2 estimates from GWAS summary statistics and in-sample LD estimates in admixed populations.
* [OCMS_16S](https://github.com/OxfordCMS/OCMS_16S) is a pipeline for 16S amplicon sequencing analysis (e.g. for microbiome analysis).
* [OCMSlooksy](https://github.com/OxfordCMS/OCMSlooksy) is an RShiny app for exploration of 16S rRNA gene data in microbiome research.
* [panpipes](https://github.com/DendrouLab/panpipes/tree/main) is a collection of pipelines for multimodal single-cell analysis.
